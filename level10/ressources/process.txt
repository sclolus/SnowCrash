Access exploit
       Warning: Using these calls to check if a user is authorized to, for example, open  a  file  before  actually
       doing  so  using  open(2)  creates  a  security hole, because the user might exploit the short time interval
       between checking and opening the file to manipulate it.  For this reason, the use of this system call should
       be  avoided.   (In  the  example  just  described,  a  safer  alternative would be to temporarily switch the
       process's effective user ID to the real ID and then call open(2).)
Lauch both scripts simultaneously, wait for the flag, ???, Profit
